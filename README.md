# Boston Evictions Web Application

## Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project was to help the Office of Housing Stability gain insight from their eviction data. The main objectives were to help the office understand geographic variation in evictions, the property managers who were evicting the most tenants, and to evaluate the Cityâ€™s progress on reducing evictions. 

## Data
The data underlying this application was intially collected by volunteers who transcribed physical records from Boston's Housing Court into an excel spreadsheet. The data was cleaned and reshaped for visualization in the app.
